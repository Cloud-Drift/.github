The **CloudDrift** project aims at propelling forward the discovery and use of atmospheric, oceanic, and climate Lagrangian data. The tools developed through this project utilize existing cyberinfrastructures and established open source and open access protocols in order to bring analyses of ocean and climate observational and numerical heterogeneously distributed geospatial data at the fingertips of users with level of proficiency ranging from high school students to statistical experts. This project aims at making more equitable access to data and computing resources for a broad spectrum of specific and interdisciplinary applications ranging from marine plastics transport to the impact of surface gravity waves on satellite sea surface temperature calibrations. A wide and diverse set of users should be able to access these notebooks which are bound to openly-accessible cloud-based executable environments deployed on existing infrastructures thanks to collaborations with the EarthCube and other cognizant communities.

The main component of the CloudDrift project is [clouddrift](https://github.com/Cloud-Drift/clouddrift) a freely accessible python library, see its [documentation](https://clouddrift.org).

Clouddrift is funded by [NSF EarthCube](https://www.earthcube.org/info) through the [EarthCube Capabilities Grant No. 2126413](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2126413).
